This is a tutorial for learning about HTML5 Microdata and the Schema.org 
vocabulary. For an example we'll implement microdata on a few pages for a 
library digital special collections site. It's a work in progress.

The hope is that this will help implementers, especially in the cultural 
heritage sector, apply Microdata to their pages. This may also help to provide
use cases for where Microdata or the Schema.org vocabulary could be adjusted
or extended to fit the needs of cultural memory organizations.
  
Follow
the steps below to move through the tutorial and learn about features of 
Microdata and Schema.org. As you go along, you will discover relevant tools. 
When there are still outstanding
questions about how to implement something in either microdata or schema.org,
there will be links to relevant discussions. Microdata is a new standard and 
schema.org a new vocabulary, so there are many points still being worked out.
