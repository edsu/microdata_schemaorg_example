<p>
  This is a tutorial for working through applying HTML5 Microdata using the
  schema.org vocabulary to a library's digital special collections pages. 
</p>

<p>NOTE: YKK in the text here is just an indication that something needs filled in still.</p>

<p>HTML5 Microdata is... YKK</p>
  
<p>Schema.org is... YKK  </p>

<p>Follow
  the steps below to move through the tutorial and learn about features of 
  Microdata and Schema.org. As you go along, you will discover relevant tools. 
When there are still outstanding
questions about how to implement something in either microdata or schema.org,
there will be links to relevant discussions. Microdata is a new standard and 
schema.org a new vocabulary, so there are many points still being worked out.
