#### Examples in the cultural heritage sector

* [NCSU Libraries' Digital Collections: Rare and Unique Materials](http://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections)
  The example in this tutorial is based on this site.
* [Indianapolis Museum of Art](http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/untitled-calder-alexander)
  Uses CreativeWork and extends the type by adding the following properties:
  accessionNumber, collection, copyright, creditLine, dimensions, materials.
* [Steve](http://tagger.steve.museum/steve/object/14534) 
  A project associated with the IMA and other museums for tagging objects.
  As of this writing, it doesn't parse correctly, though the markup is there.
* [Biodiversity Heritage Library](http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/51518)
  Adds an "OCLC" property for a Book.
* [Sudoc French academic union catalogue](http://www.sudoc.fr/132133520.html) 
  Seems to only show the microdata representation to crawlers?

#### Other lists of examples

* [Sindice Search](http://sindice.com/search?q=schema&nq=&fq=class%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fschema.org%2F*%20format%3AMICRODATA&interface=guru&facet.field=domain)
  This search can be adjusted to find a specific schema.org type (class here).
  Faceting by the Microdata does not always seem to find sites that predominantly
  use Microdata rather than RDFa.
