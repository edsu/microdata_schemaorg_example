### 5. adding a `Photograph` item and nesting

Looking at the hierarchy of all schema types, we definitely
want to describe that the page is `about` a [Photograph](http://schema.org/Photograph)



The schema.org vocabulary often expects the value of a particular property to be 
an item itself.
This means that on the same element that has the `itemprop` there would also
be `itemscope` and `itemtype` attributes, which would contain its own properties.

In our case the `div#metadata` already has an `itemprop="about"` and adding in
`itemscope` and `itemtype` results in:

    <div id="metadata" itemprop="about" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph">
      
Again, this translates to: the `ItemPage` is `about` a `Photograph`. 
This nests the `Photograph` within the `ItemPage`. You can have any number of
levels deep, as we will see soon as another level is added within the `Photograph`.

Whether to nest or not is a common question YKK. Currently, the Google Rich
Snippets testing tool only knows about certain item types and for those sometimes
only displays possible rich snippets when the recognized item is not nested YKK.

So far the `Photograph` includes no properties, so let's add some now. Within the
[Photograph Information](#item) section of the page, there is some metadata
we are already using to describe the photograph. 

applying an extra span since the value we want isn't the anchor's href attribute 
value, but the text within the `a`.

In this case we could put the `itemprop="keywords"` on the `dd` element, which
surrounds all of the text of keywords. 

There is [some confusion]() about singulars and plurals in schema.org. Related
to the plurals problem is whether properties are intended to be repeated or not.
It is valid microdata to do it either way, but the vocabulary could specify a
preference. 


Since this is a photograph, we'll want to add the image on the page as the
`image` property to the `Photograph`. The only problem is that because of the
layout and grid system used, the image is not nested within the `div` which
holds the `Photograph`. So as you see below, there is no image associated with
the `Photograph`.
The [next page](/steps/6.html) will reveal the solution 
for this problem.
