### 4. The `ItemPage` is `about` a `Photograph`

Now that we have some basic microdata on the page, let's try to to describe more
items on the page. Looking at the valid properties for an [ItemPage](http://schema.org/ItemPage),
a [CreativeWork](http://schema.org/CreativeWork), of which an ItemPage is one,
can have an `about` property.

If we add `itemprop="about"` to the `div` containing all metadata, then we get the 
JSON output as listed below. Notice that what is extracted from the page is just 
the text content, including any line breaks. Microdata processing does not
maintain any of the markup at all. (If you need to maintain some XML or other markup,
then [consider](YKK) using microformats or RDfa, which have the ability to maintain
XML literals.)

Looking more closely at how schema.org specifies the expected value of the `about`
property, though, we see that it should be another 
[Thing](http://schema.org/Thing). Microdata is specified in a way where if the
author of the page gets it wrong, the processor may still be able to do something
useful with even just that text content. Processors should expect bad data [YKK]().

In the [next step](/steps/5.html) we'll see how to mark that
item up properly.
