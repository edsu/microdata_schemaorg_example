### 4. the ItemPage is `about` a Photograph

Now that we have some basic microdata on the page, let's try to to describe more
items on the page. 

What is extracted from the page is just the text content. Microdata processing does not
maintain any of the markup. (If you need to maintain some XML or other markup,
then [consider]() using microformats or RDfa, which have the ability to maintain
XML literals.)
