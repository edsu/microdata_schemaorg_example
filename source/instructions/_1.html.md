### 1. Before Microdata

Those students are excited to learn about HTML5 Microdata and Schema.org!

The page for each step has a section like this one which lists the instructions 
for the current step. This will lead you through the 

Above is a photograph and some related metadata about the photograph. While 
the page above should look the same in your browser for each step, the markup will
change slightly to add some microdata to the page. You can use the developer
tools for your browser to search the code to see this markup.

You'll see in the box below that no microdata items are discovered on the 
page. On this page you see a JSON Object, with the single key "items" with a
value of an empty array. This means that there is currently no microdata on the
page. As we add
in microdata attributes, you will see the extracted data at the bottom of the 
page in pretty-printed JSON format.

The HTML here is basically extracted from [this page](http://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/0004493).

Go on to the [next step](/steps/2.html) to really get started.
