### 1. Before Microdata

The HTML here is basically extracted from [this page](http://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/0004493).

As we go along, we will discover new tools. When there are still outstanding
questions about how to implement something in either microdata or schema.org,
there will be links to relevant discussions. Microdata is a new standard and 
schema.org a new vocabulary, so there are many points still being worked out.

You'll see below in the box below that no microdata items are discovered on the 
page. As we add
in microdata attributes, you will see the extracted data at the bottom of the 
page in pretty-printed JSON format.
