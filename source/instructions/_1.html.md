### 1. Before Microdata

The page for each step has a section like this one labeled "Step Instructions" 
which lists the instructions 
for the current step. These will lead you through the decisions that are made
the the problems that are encounted in implementing microdata and schema.org.

[Above](#page_name) is a photograph and some related metadata about the photograph. While 
that page fragment above should look about the same in your browser for each step, 
the markup will change slightly to add some microdata to the page. A light 
outline will be added to elements where microdata has been added. If you can't 
see the outline, don't worry. You can use the developer
tools for your browser to search the code to see this markup.

Those students are excited to learn about HTML5 Microdata and Schema.org!

You'll see in the box below that no microdata items are discovered on the 
page. On this page you see a JSON Object, with the single key "items" with a
value of an empty array. This means that there is currently no microdata on the
page. As we add
in microdata attributes, you will see the extracted data at the bottom of the 
page in pretty-printed JSON format.

The HTML of the page fragment above is basically extracted from 
[this page](http://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/0004493).
