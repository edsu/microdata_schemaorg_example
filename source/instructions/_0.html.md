NOTE: YKK in the text here is just an indication that something needs filled in still.

HTML5 Microdata is... YKK
  
Schema.org is... YKK  

Here's an example:

<p itemscope="" itemtype="Person" class="md">
  This tutorial was created by 
  <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ronallo" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jason Ronallo</span></a>, 
  <span itemprop="jobTitle">Digital Collections Technology Librarian</span> at
  <span itemprop="affiliation" itemscope="" itemtype="Organization"><a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">North Carolina State University Libraries</span></a></span>. 
  Feel free to contact me about this tutorial or microdata and schema.org
  generally, at <span itemprop="email">jronallo@gmail.com</span>.
</p>

In this tutorial item properties are highlighted with a light yellow outline
to help find the new microdata that has been added to the page.


While you can inspect the above markup with Chrome's Developer Tools or 
Firefox's Firebug, here's the markup for the snippet. (YKK make sure the code is updated.)



    <p itemscope itemtype="Person" class="md">
      This tutorial was created by 
      <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ronallo" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jason Ronallo</span></a>, 
      <span itemprop="jobTitle">Digital Collections Technology Librarian</span> at
      
      <span itemprop="affiliation" itemscope itemtype="Organization"><a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">North Carolina State University Libraries</span></a></span>. 
      
      Feel free to contact me about this tutorial or microdata and schema.org
      generally, at <span itemprop="email">jronallo@gmail.com</span>.
    </p>

    
At the top of the page for each step will be the markup for a page about a
photograph. Scroll down to find the information about the current step.

OK, you're ready for the [first step](/steps/1.html#step_instructions).
