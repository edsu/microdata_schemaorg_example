NOTE: YKK in the text here is just an indication that something needs filled in still.

On June 2, 2011 [Bing](http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2011/06/02/bing-google-and-yahoo-unite-to-build-the-web-of-objects.aspx), 
[Google](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-schemaorg-search-engines.html ), and 
[Yahoo](http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2011/06/introducing-schema-org-a-collaboration-on-structured-data/ ) 
announced the joint effort [Schema.org](http://schema.org). When the big search
engines talk, the web listens. All of the examples
on the schema.org site used HTML5 Microdata.

The [HTML5 standard](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) 
(or [HTML Living Standard](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/), 
depnding on who you ask) has brought a lot of changes to web authoring.
HTML5 Microdata is a new semantic markup standard that often went overlooked in
all the buzz about other features. HTML elements often have
some semantics. For example, an `ol` is an ordered list. 
With HTML5 we also have new elements 
like `header`, `article`, and `footer` that allow more expressiveness for page 
authors than using a bunch
of `div`s to divide up content. These new elements allow web browsers and search 
engines to display and use content
in new ways. A search engine can give more weight to the main content `article`
of the page than to the advertising in the sitebar. 

While that is useful extra information about the content, it provides no deeper
understanding of what the `article` is *about*. Microdata is a syntax which,
when used in combination with a vocabulary, can provide more meaning for the
content. 

This goal in itself is nothing new.
Other efforts came before Microdata trying to solve this same problem of making
meaning of content. Of the main syntaxes used today,
[Microformats](http://microformats.org/) was an [early effort](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-data-tf/2011Dec/0030.html)
to provide "a general approach
of using visible HTML markup to publish structured data to the web." 
Some Microformat
specifications like [hCard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard), 
[hCalendar](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar), and 
[rel-license](http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-license) are in common use across
the web. Simply put, Microformats usually use the convention of standard class 
names to provide meaning on a web page. The latest version [microformats-2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats-2)
simplifies and harmonizes the conventions significantly.

Another standard, RDFa has the vision of 
"[Bridging the Human and Data Webs](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/)".
The idea is to provide attributes and processing rules for embedding RDF, and
all of its graph-based linked data goodness, in HTML. One of the main reasons
for the search engines choosing Microdata over RDFa, which at least Google had
supported in some fashion since 2009, was the [large error rate](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vocabs/2011Oct/0113.html)
in the application of RDFa by webmasters. RDFa is currently going
through a rewrite of the specification. As part of this work, and in some part in
reaction to greater adoption of Microdata, a simplified profile of RDFa has been created
known as [RDFa Lite 1.1](http://www.w3.org/2010/02/rdfa/sources/rdfa-lite/Overview-src.html).
RDFa Lite is a profile of RDFa for simpler authoring guidelines that 
[mirror more closely the syntax of Microdata](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-data-tf/2011Nov/0070.html).

#### So what is Microdata?

Microdata came out of a [long thread about incorporating RDFa in HTML5](http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/124).
Out of that thread and collected use cases [Ian "Hixie" Hickson](http://hixie.ch/),
the editor of the HTML5 specification,
showed the first work on Microdata on [May 10, 2009](http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-May/019681.html).

The Microdata syntax is made up of some attributes, with only three new HTML
attributes that are core to the data model. Microdata creates items and each
item is made up of one or more key value pairs, a property and its value. 
It is possible to nest further items as 
Microdata uses a tree structure rather than a graph-based one.

#### What is Schema.org?

We will get to some simple examples of applying Microdata in a moment, but first
need to 

You can browse the [full hierarchy](http://schema.org/docs/full.html) of the vocabulary.

Schema.org is... YKK  

#### So Why use Microdata + Schema.org?

YKK
* schema.org is what the search engines understand
* microdata is simple. in my own experience (a longer example which will follow)
* examples on schema.org in microdata

Rich Snippets.


#### Examples of Microdata + Schema.org

In this tutorial items will be outlines in pink and item properties are
highlighted with a light yellow outline. These are intended to help find the 
new microdata that has been added to the page.

While you can inspect the above markup with Chrome's Developer Tools or 
Firefox's Firebug, here's the markup for the snippet. (YKK make sure the code is updated.)
