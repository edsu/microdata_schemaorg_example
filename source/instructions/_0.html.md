On June 2, 2011 [Bing](http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2011/06/02/bing-google-and-yahoo-unite-to-build-the-web-of-objects.aspx), 
[Google](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-schemaorg-search-engines.html ), and 
[Yahoo](http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2011/06/introducing-schema-org-a-collaboration-on-structured-data/ ) 
announced the joint effort [Schema.org](http://schema.org). When the big search
engines talk, the web listens. This article is an introduction
to Microdata and Schema.org. An in-depth example will be given about how to apply
these new technologies to a site for cultural heritage materials.

The [HTML5 standard](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) 
(or [HTML Living Standard](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/), 
depnding on who you ask) has brought a lot of changes to web authoring.
HTML5 Microdata is a new semantic markup standard that often went overlooked in
all the buzz about other features. HTML elements often have
some semantics. For example, an `ol` element is an ordered list, and be default
gets rendered with numbers for the list items. 
With HTML5 we also have new semantic elements 
like `header`, `article`, and `footer` that allow more expressiveness for page 
authors than using a bunch
of `div`s to divide up content. These new elements allow web browsers and search 
engines to display and use content
in new ways. A search engine could give more weight to the main content `article`
of the page than to the advertising in the sitebar. 

While these new elements provide useful extra information about the content, 
they provides no deeper
understanding of what the `article` is *about*. Microdata is a syntax which,
when used in combination with a vocabulary, can provide more meaning for the
content. In the same way that these new elements are invible to users, they can
be made visible with CSS, bookmarklets, or browser plugins. For the most part,
though, the purpose is to provide meaning to machines.

You probably have a lot of structured data already that you are not communicating 
to search engines. In many cases you are probably
using a nicely normalized relational database with a lot of information about
those resources, but putting that information in HTML loses a lot of what you
already know about them. 

One way out of this is to provide an alternative 
representation of your data separate from the HTML representation. You could
even help with auto-detection of that content by providing an alternative link
in the `head` of your document to point to the type of data you want to make
an alternative representation. Here a simple [example](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/htmldata/raw-file/default/html-data-guide/index.html#scope) 
of making calendar data available:

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/calendar" value="calendar.ics" />
    
And another [example](http://inkdroid.org/journal/2011/09/22/stepping-backwards/) 
of making RIS formatted citation data available:

    <link rel="alternate" type="application/x-research-info-systems" href="/search?q=cartoons&format=ris" />
    
The problem with techniques like this is that they do not use the visible content
of the HTML. It is the HTML representation which is most visible to users, so it
is also the HTML code which gets the most attention from developers. It is too
easy to allow a little-used and easy to overlook, API or data feed go stale.
If the website goes down, you are likely to hear about it from multiple sources
at once. If the OAI-PMH gateway goes down, I'm guessing it would take longer
for you to find out about it. Hidden services and content are too easy to get
neglected or out of sync.

This goal of providing structured data and meaning to machines through visible
HTML in itself is nothing new.
Other efforts came before Microdata trying to solve this same problem of marking
up the meaning of content. Of the main syntaxes used today,
[Microformats](http://microformats.org/) was an [early effort](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-data-tf/2011Dec/0030.html)
to provide "a general approach
of using visible HTML markup to publish structured data to the web." 
Some Microformat
specifications like [hCard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard), 
[hCalendar](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar), and 
[rel-license](http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-license) are in common use across
the web. Simply put, Microformats usually use the convention of standard class 
names to provide meaning on a web page. The latest version [microformats-2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats-2)
simplifies and harmonizes these conventions across specifications significantly.

A standard of the W3C, RDFa has the vision of 
"[Bridging the Human and Data Webs](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/)".
The idea is to provide attributes and processing rules for embedding RDF, and
all of its graph-based, linked data goodness, in HTML. One of the main reasons
for the search engines choosing Microdata over RDFa, which at least Google had
supported in some fashion since 2009, was the [large error rate](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vocabs/2011Oct/0113.html)
in the application of RDFa by webmasters. Applying RDFa has proven too 
complicated for many page authors.
RDFa is currently going
through a rewrite of the specification. As part of this work, and in some part in
reaction to greater adoption of Microdata, a simplified profile of RDFa has been created
known as [RDFa Lite 1.1](http://www.w3.org/2010/02/rdfa/sources/rdfa-lite/Overview-src.html).
RDFa Lite is a profile of RDFa for simpler authoring guidelines that 
[mirror more closely the syntax of Microdata](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-data-tf/2011Nov/0070.html).

It also bears mentioning that in the library space, we've had [unAPI](YKK) 
and [COinS](YKK) 
which tried to solve similar problems of making structured data available through
HTML pages.

#### So what is Microdata?

Microdata came out of a [long thread about incorporating RDFa in HTML5](http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/124).
Because RDFa simply was not going to be incorporated into HTML5 for a variety of
reasons (YKK), something else was needed to fill the gap.
Out of that thread and collected use cases [Ian "Hixie" Hickson](http://hixie.ch/),
the editor of the HTML5 specification,
showed the first work on Microdata on [May 10, 2009](http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-May/019681.html).

The Microdata syntax is made up of some attributes, with only three new HTML
attributes that are core to the data model. Microdata creates items and each
item is made up of one or more key value pairs, a property and its value. 
It is possible to nest further items as as the value of a parent item's property.
Microdata uses a tree structure rather than a graph-based one.

Here's a simple snippet of Microdata:

    <div itemscope itemtype="organization">
      <span itemprop="name">code4lib</span>
    </div>
    
The user of a browser would only see the text "code4lib".
This snippet creates a single "item" in Microdata terms through the `@itemscope`
attribute, which requires no value. The type of item is set by the `@itemtype`
attribute and in this case has a value of "organization". The item has a single
key-value pair--the property "name" with a value of "code4lib". Or simply: 
An organization has the name code4lib.

Those three are the only attributes necessary for a complete understanding of the 
Microdata model. Pretty simple, right? We'll show some other simple examples 
shortly.

This is completely valid Microdata, but the problem with this snippet is that 
it uses arbitrary language for its `@itemtype` and `@itemprop` values. If you
live in your own little closed world, that may be just fine. But for the most
part you probably want other people's machines to understand the meaning of
your content.

#### What is Schema.org?

This is where schema.org comes in. Schema.org is a 

You can browse the [full hierarchy](http://schema.org/docs/full.html) of the vocabulary.

Schema.org is... YKK  

#### So Why use Microdata + Schema.org?

YKK
* schema.org is what the search engines understand
* microdata is simple. in my own experience (a longer example which will follow)
* examples on schema.org in microdata

In this tutorial items will be outlines in pink and item properties are
highlighted with a light yellow outline. These are intended to help find the 
new microdata that has been added to the page.

While you can inspect the above markup with Chrome's Developer Tools or 
Firefox's Firebug, here's the markup for the snippet. (YKK make sure the code is updated.)
