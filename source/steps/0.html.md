NOTE: YKK in the text here is just an indication that something needs filled in still.

On June 2, 2011 [Bing](http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2011/06/02/bing-google-and-yahoo-unite-to-build-the-web-of-objects.aspx), 
[Google](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-schemaorg-search-engines.html ), 
and 
[Yahoo](http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2011/06/introducing-schema-org-a-collaboration-on-structured-data/ ) 
announced the joint effort [Schema.org](http://schema.org). When the big search
engines talk, web site authors listen. This article is an introduction
to Microdata and Schema.org. 
The tutorial will lead you through implementing these new technologies on a 
site for discovery of cultural heritage materials.
Along the way, you will be introduced to some tools for implementers and some
issues with applying this to cultural heritage materials.

#### HTML5

The [HTML5 standard](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) 
(or [HTML Living Standard](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/), 
depending on who you ask) has brought a lot of changes to web authoring.
Amongst all the buzz about HTML5 (some of which is not even part of the HTML spec),
HTML5 Microdata, a new semantic markup syntax that is part of the HTML standard,
often went overlooked. HTML elements often have
some semantics. For example, an `ol` element is an ordered list, and by default
gets rendered with numbers for the list items. 
With HTML5 we also have new semantic elements 
like `header`, `nav`, `article`, and `footer` that allow more expressiveness for 
page authors than using a bunch
of `div`s with various class names to divide up content. These new elements 
allow web browsers and search engines to display and use content
in new ways. A search engine could give more weight to the main content `article`
of the page than to the advertising in the sidebar. 

While these new elements provide useful extra information about the content, 
they provide no deeper understanding of what the `article` is *about*. 
In many cases you are probably
using a nicely normalized relational database with a lot of fielded information 
about your resources, but putting that information in HTML loses a lot of what you
already know. The trip from the database into HTML results in lost meaning.
Maybe a human can read your field labels to understand your metadata, but
that meaning is lost on machines.

#### One Simple Solution

One way out of this is to provide an alternative 
representation of your data separate from the HTML representation. You could
even help with auto-detection of that content by providing an alternative link
in the `head` of your document. Here is a simple [example](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/htmldata/raw-file/default/html-data-guide/index.html#scope) 
of making calendar data available:

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/calendar" value="calendar.ics" />
    
The link provides the type of the alternative representation and a relative URL 
where it can be found.
Here's another [example](http://inkdroid.org/journal/2011/09/22/stepping-backwards/) 
of making RIS formatted citation data available:

    <link rel="alternate" type="application/x-research-info-systems" href="/search?q=cartoons&format=ris" />
    
This approach can work in many cases, but it has some problems.
Techniques like this do not use the visible content
of the HTML, so your consumers have to know to look for such invisible content.
Also, the HTML representation is most visible to users, so it
is also the HTML code which gets the most attention from developers. 
Little-used, overlooked APIs or data feeds are easy to let go stale.
If the website goes down, you are likely to hear about it from multiple sources
at once. If the OAI-PMH gateway goes down, I am guessing that it would take longer
for you to find out about it. Hidden services and content are too easy to get
neglected. Data embedded in visible HTML helps keep the representations in sync.

#### History of Structured Data in HTML

This goal of providing structured data and meaning to machines through visible
HTML in itself is nothing new.
Other efforts that came before Microdata have solved this same problem of marking
up the meaning of content. Of the main syntaxes used today,
[Microformats](http://microformats.org/) was an [early effort](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-data-tf/2011Dec/0030.html)
to provide "a general approach
of using visible HTML markup to publish structured data to the web." 
Some Microformat
specifications like [hCard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard), 
[hCalendar](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar), and 
[rel-license](http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-license) are in common use across
the web. Simply put, Microformats usually use the convention of standard class 
names to provide meaning on a web page. The latest version [microformats-2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats-2)
simplifies and harmonizes these conventions across specifications significantly.

A standard of the W3C, RDFa has the vision of 
"[Bridging the Human and Data Webs](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/)".
The idea is to provide attributes and processing rules for embedding RDF, and
all of its graph-based, linked data goodness, in HTML. 
Implementing RDFa has been overly complex for many web developers. Google had
supported RDFa in some fashion since 2009, and over that time had discovered
a [large error rate](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vocabs/2011Oct/0113.html)
in the application of RDFa by webmasters. 
Simplicity is one of the main reasons for the search engines preferring 
Microdata over RDFa.
In part in
reaction to greater adoption of Microdata, a simplified profile of RDFa has been 
created. [RDFa Lite 1.1](http://www.w3.org/2010/02/rdfa/sources/rdfa-lite/Overview-src.html)
provides simpler authoring guidelines that 
[mirror more closely the syntax of Microdata](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-data-tf/2011Nov/0070.html).

It also bears mentioning that in the library space, we have developed 
specifications which tried to solve similar problems of making structured data 
available to machines through HTML pages.
The [unAPI](http://unapi.info/) specification uses a microformat for 
exposing (through the [deprecated `abbr` method](http://microformats.org/wiki/value-class-pattern)) 
the presence of identifiers  
which may resolve to alternative formats through a service. 
[COinS](http://ocoins.info/) uses empty spans to make OpenURL context objects
available for autodiscovery by machines.
 
#### So what is Microdata?

Microdata came out of a [long thread about incorporating RDFa in HTML5](http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/124).
Because RDFa simply was not going to be incorporated into HTML5, 
something else was needed to fill the gap.
Out of that thread and collected use cases [Ian "Hixie" Hickson](http://hixie.ch/),
the editor of the HTML5 specification,
showed the first work on Microdata on [May 10, 2009](http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-May/019681.html)
(the syntax has changed some since then).

In Microdata terms, the things being described are items. Each
item is made up of one or more key-value pairs.
The Microdata syntax is made up of attributes, only three new HTML
attributes are core to the data model:

* `itemscope` says that there is a new item
* `itemtype` specifies the type of item
* `itemprop` gives the item properties

#### First Example

    <div itemscope itemtype="unorganization">
      <span itemprop="name">code4lib</span>
    </div>
    
The user of a browser would only see the text "code4lib".
The snippet provides more meaning for machines by asserting that there is an 
"unorganization" with the name "code4lib."

The `@itemscope` attribute creates an item and requires no value.
The `@itemtype` attribute asserts that the type of thing being described is an 
"unorganization."
The item has a single
key-value pair--the property "name" with a value of "code4lib."

To make it clear to someone who thinks in JSON, here is what the item would look
like:

    {
      "type": [
        "unorganization"
      ],
      "properties": {
        "name": [
          "code4lib"
        ]
      }
    }

Those are the only three attributes necessary for a complete understanding of the 
Microdata model. Pretty simple, right? We'll show some other simple examples 
shortly.

While this is completely valid Microdata,  
it uses arbitrary language for its `@itemtype` and `@itemprop` values. If you
live in your own little closed world, that may be just fine. But for the most
part you probably want other people's machines to understand the meaning of
your content. You need to use a shared language so that page authors and
consumers can cooperate on how to interpret the meaning.

#### What is Schema.org?

This is where schema.org comes in. Schema.org is a vocabulary. The search  
engines (Bing, Google, Yahoo) created Schema.org 
and have agreed to support and understand it. 
The domain it covers is broad, sometimes called a Web-scale vocabulary 
or ["middle" ontology](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vocabs/2011Nov/0006.html).
One goal of having such a broad schema all in one place is to 
[simplify things for mass adoption](http://blog.schema.org/2011/11/using-rdfa-11-lite-with-schemaorg.html?showComment=1321045329383#c3006481536068088400)
and cover the most common use cases.
You can browse the 
[full hierarchy of the vocabulary](http://schema.org/docs/full.html) to get a 
feel of the bounds of the world according to search engines. 

#### So Why use Microdata + Schema.org?

Microdata and Schema.org have a tight connection, though each can be used without
the other.
The search engines are currently the main consumers
of Schema.org data and have a stated preference for Microdata.

##### Rich Snippets

The most obvious way that the search engines are currently using
Microdata is to be able to display rich snippets in search results. You can see
good examples of how powerful this is by using doing a [Google Recipe Search](http://www.google.com/landing/recipes/)
for "vegan cupcakes":

<p>
<img alt="Rich Snippet for Vegan Cupcakes" src="/images/vegan_cupcakes.png"/>
</p>

This search result snippet for a recipe includes an image, reviews, cooking 
time, calorie count, some of the text introducing the recipe, and a list of
some of the ingredients needed. This gives a lot more scent to the user for 
clicking on a particular result.
Snippets with this kind of extra information are
reported to [increase click through rates](http://www.heppresearch.com/gr4google). 

Google started presenting rich snippets [in 2009](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/05/introducing-rich-snippets.html). 
Using embedded markup like microformats, RDFa or Microdata, page authors 
can influence what could show up in a search result snippet.
Both [Microformats](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=146897) 
and [RDFa](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=146898) 
were promoted
for rich snippets in the past and continue to be supported. 
Google [added support for Microdata for Rich Snippets](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/03/microdata-support-for-rich-snippets.html) 
in early 2010. After RDFa Lite was created, the Schema.org partners agreed to
support that syntax as well.

Currently, the main reason to be using Microdata with Schema.org is that it is
the latest search-engine preferred method for exposing structured data in HTML.
While other consumers for structured data using Microdata and/or Schema.org may
appear in the future, the [most compelling uses cases](YKK Hixie on use cases) 
are currently for use by the search engines.

There are [many considerations]() for choosing a 
Microdata has a natural fit with HTML
YKK
* microdata is simple. in my own experience (a longer example which will follow)
* fits well with HTML. easy to implement.


#### Examples of Microdata + Schema.org

YKK move this section to the one on Historic Events or add more to section?
Here's an example of applying Microdata and Schema.org to advertising the 2012
national code4lib conference.

<div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Event" class="md">
  <h2 itemprop="name">Code4Lib 2012 Conference</h2>
  <div itemprop="location" itemscope="" itemtype="Place">
    <span itemprop="name">Seattle, Washington</span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <meta itemprop="startDate" content="2012-02-06"/>
    <meta itemprop="endDate" content="2012-02-09"/>
    February 6-9, 2012
  </div>
  <div itemprop="description">
    Code4lib 2012 is a loosely-structured conference for library technologists 
    to commune, gather/create/share ideas and software, be inspired, and forge 
    collaborations.
  </div>
</div>

In this tutorial items will be outlined in pink and item properties are
highlighted with a light yellow outline. These are intended to help find the 
new microdata that has been added to the page. This is done through this
simple CSS:

    [itemprop] {outline: solid #FFF27F 2px;}
    [itemtype] {outline: solid #FF857F 2px;}

While you can inspect the above markup with Chrome's Developer Tools or 
Firefox's Firebug, here's the markup for the snippet. (YKK make sure the code is updated.)
