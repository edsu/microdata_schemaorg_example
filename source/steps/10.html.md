### 10. `itemid`

The Memorial Bell Tower is a unique resource which can be represented by this
Freebase URI:

YKK this section needs some work:

In Microdata the [`itemid` attribute](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/microdata.html#attr-itemid) 
can be used to associate an item with a
globally unique URL identifier, "so that it can be related to other items on pages
elsewhere on the web." The meaning of the `@itemid` attribute is 
determined by the vocabulary. The example given in the [Microdata documentation](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/microdata.html#global-identifiers-for-items) 
is for a book with `itemid="urn:isbn:0-330-34032-8"`. This is the main 
mechanism by which Microdata natively supports something like linked data. 
("Item types are opaque identifiers, and user agents must not dereference 
unknown item types, or otherwise deconstruct them, in order to determine how to 
process items that use them." [Items](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/microdata.html#items))

YKK discussion of description of a page as opposed to RDF.

Unfortunately, Schema.org 
[does not document any use or support for the `itemid` attribute](http://www.w3.org/2011/webschema/track/issues/6)
at this time, though they ["strongly encourage the use of itemids"](http://groups.google.com/group/schemaorg-discussion/msg/f3317f1482d56232). 
The semantics of `itemid` Schema.org context seems 
[uncertain and overlapping with the consistent use of url properties](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vocabs/2011Nov/0023.html).

We'll add an `itemid` in any case just to show how it would parse to JSON below.
