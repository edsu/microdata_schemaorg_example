In Microdata the [`itemid` attribute](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/microdata.html#attr-itemid) 
can be used to associate an item with a
globally unique URL identifier, "so that it can be related to other items on pages
elsewhere on the web." The meaning of the `@itemid` attribute is 
determined by the vocabulary. The example given in the [Microdata documentation](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/microdata.html#global-identifiers-for-items) 
is for a book with `itemid="urn:isbn:0-330-34032-8"`. This is the main 
mechanism by which Microdata natively supports anything approaching linked data.

Unfortunately, Schema.org does not specify any use for the `itemid` attribute.
We'll add an `itemid` in any case just to show how it would parse to JSON below.
